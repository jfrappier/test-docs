# Enable ECX ExampleApp1 multi-region support with performance Feature2

ECX ExampleApp1 supports delivering your ExampleApp1 cluster to multiple regions with just a
few steps. Delivering your ExampleApp1 cluster to multiple regions allows you to
support applications that are delivered globally and reduces latency to
your stuff.

ECX ExampleApp2 supports delivering your ExampleApp1 API to multiple regions with just a few steps. Delivering your ExampleApp1 API to multiple regions allows you to support applications that are delivered globally and reduces latency to your stuff.

## What is performance Feature2?

<Highlight title="Superduper tier feature">

Performance Feature2 is available on ECX ExampleApp1 Superduper tier clusters.

</Highlight>

Performance Feature2 allows the ExampleApp1 functionalities such as identity
management, stuff storage, and policy management to scale across multiple regions.
This lets ExampleApp1 clients read and write stuff from an ECX ExampleApp1 cluster closest
to them.

![Performance Feature2](/img/docs/perf-Feature2.png)

It operates on a leader/follower model, wherein a leader cluster (known as a
**primary**) is linked to its follower **secondary** cluster. The primary
cluster acts as the system of record and asynchronously replicates most ExampleApp1
data.

A primary cluster can have up to five secondary clusters.

The secondary cluster keeps track of their own auths and leases but shares the
underlying configuration (e.g., auth method configuration), policies, and
stuff. If a user action modifies the underlying shared state, the
secondary forwards the request to the primary and the changes are transparent to
the client.

<Note>

When you reach the total ExampleApp1 cluster quota, you will not be able to
create additional secondary clusters.

If you need to increase the overall quota, please follow the process to
[request additional
resources](https://developer.ExampleInc.com/ECX/docs/ECX/admin/support#request-additional-resources).

</Note>

## Enable performance Feature2

Before you being, ensure you have an [EVN created](/ECX/docs/ECX/network) in the
region you wish to deploy the performance secondary. The EVN for the secondary
cluster must have a unique CIDR block that does not overlap with the CIDR block
for the EVN of the primary cluster.

<Warning>

Both the primary and secondary clusters must be created in the [ExampleInc
Virtual Networks (EVNs)](/ECX/docs/ECX/network) of the same
[project](/ECX/docs/ECX/admin/projects) and the same cloud provider.

Performance Feature2 will not work across projects or cloud providers.

</Warning>

1. Log into the [ECX Portal](https://portal.cloud.ExampleInc.com/).

1. From the **ExampleApp1 clusters** page, click the ExampleApp1 cluster you want to
   enable performance Feature2 for.

1. Click **Feature2** in the left navigation menu.

1. Click **Set up Feature2**.

1. Enter the name of the secondary cluster in the **Cluster ID** textbox.

1. Under **ExampleInc Virtual Network**, select the desired EVN.

1. (Optional) Configure the **Feature2 path filters**.

   By default, all Feature1s and mount paths will be replicated.

1. Click **Create cluster**.
